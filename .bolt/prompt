NEVER overcomplicate anything, always use the simplest way possible to implement ANYTHING!

If I tell you a game is an exact copy of another game, you make an EXACT copy, and only change the few keys that are unique to that game.

Standard keys:
- game.selectCategory
- game.startGame
- game.next
- game.noStatements
- game.loadingMore
